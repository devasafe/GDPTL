## Project Status

**Frontend**: React + Vite running on http://localhost:5173/
**Backend**: Express + Node.js running on port 4000
**Database**: MongoDB Atlas (configure MONGODB_URI in backend/.env)
**Media**: Cloudinary (configure credentials in backend/.env)

## Next Steps

1. Create backend/.env from backend/.env.example
2. Configure MongoDB Atlas connection string
3. Configure Cloudinary credentials
4. Run `POST /api/auth/seed-admin` to create admin user
5. Test login at http://localhost:5173/login
6. Deploy frontend to Vercel
7. Deploy backend to Render

## Development

- Frontend dev: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- Backend dev: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- Frontend build: `npm run build --prefix frontend`
- Lint: `npm run lint` in respective folders
